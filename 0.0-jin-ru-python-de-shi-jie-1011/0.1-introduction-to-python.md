> ## Python is powerful... and fast; plays well with others; runs everywhere; is friendly & easy to learn; is Open.

## Why Python?

* Python 可以運作於各式各樣不同的平台 \(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc\).
* Python 的語法和一般的英文很像
* Python 可以用簡短的程式碼達到與其他程式語言一樣的效果
* Python 是直譯式的
* Python 同時支援 Procedural Programming、Object-oriented Programming、Functional Programming
* Python 是 Whitespace-Based Syntax，代表寫出來的程式碼都會很美觀
* Python 是全世界[第三多人](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)使用的程式語言！

## Python 的強大應用

* 網路應用程式
* 數值分析
* 作業系統
* 深度學習
* 科學計算
* ...
* **遊戲製作**

## Python 小歷史

* 創始人 Guido van Rossum 是一位荷蘭程式設計師，在1989年的聖誕節期間，開發了Python程式語言，作為ABC語言的繼承。
* Python 2.0 於 2000年10月16日發布
* Python 3.0 於 2008年12月3日發布

> **The Zen of Python**

> by **Tim Peters**
>
> Beautiful is better than ugly.  
> Explicit is better than implicit.  
> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.  
> Flat is better than nested.  
> Sparse is better than dense.  
> Readability counts.  
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
> Although practicality beats purity.  
> Errors should never pass silently.  
> Unless explicitly silenced.  
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
> Now is better than never.  
> Although never is often better than \*right\* now.  
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
